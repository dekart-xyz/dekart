## How it works

Dekart is a self-hosted backend for Kepler.gl, built with Golang and React. It connects to your data warehouse, caches query results, and serves them to the frontend for visualization.

## Deployment Options

Dekart is single Docker container that can be deployed to any cloud provider or on-premises server. It requires a PostgreSQL database to store user data and Cloud Storage for caching query results.
